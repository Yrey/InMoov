/**
 * How to install wxPython 4
 */

Windows and macOS:

    Use command line:
        pip install -U wxPython

Linux:
    
    Install the prerequisites:
        dpkg-dev
        build-essential
        python2.7-dev # use appropriate Python version here
        libjpeg-dev
        libtiff-dev
        libsdl1.2-dev
        libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev
        libnotify-dev
        freeglut3
        freeglut3-dev
        libsm-dev
        libgtk-3-dev
        libwebkitgtk-3.0-dev # or libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev if available
        libxtst-dev

        If you are building for GTK2 then you'll also need these packages and their dependencies:

            libgtk2.0-dev
            libwebkitgtk-dev

        If your Linux distribution has gstreamer 1.0 available then you can install the dev packages for that instead of the 0.10 version. For example:

            libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev

        Newer versions of Linux may need some newer versions of dependent packages installed, if they are available. For example:

            libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev
            libsdl2-dev

    Then install:
        sudo pip install --upgrade --trusted-host wxpython.org --pre -f http://wxpython.org/Phoenix/snapshot-builds/ wxPython_Phoenix
